Geocities-ASCII Themed Site <br>
(Because I can.)

<div align=left><h2>Why?</h2>

This whole thing started when I did HackClub and made a small NFC-based PCB business card. I didn't know what to add, so I put an ASCII art image of myself on it. (Fig. 1)

But then it occured to me, I didn't actually know what I wanted to write to the card. So I decided to follow the cards theme and make an old-style site based on GeoCities, and found <a href="https://github.com/neocities/neocities"> Neocities </a> in the process, an awesome community continuing the tradition of free web hosting. (If you're wondering, yes! It is so ancient it actually only lets you use HTML/CSS/JS. ðŸ¤£)
<br> <br>
Making little easter eggs and animations is just charming, and frankly feels like art, so this is super fun! :)
<br>
If you like clacking on your computer and you're bored, you should try it too!

This theme was inspired by:
