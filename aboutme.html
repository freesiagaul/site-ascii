<div class="text-md hero-abt"> I am often asked this, especially about my childhood, so for the very curious, here's a tale. <br>
  I'm an open book - but it's a long and windy book.
</div>
  <div class="text-md hero-abt">Buckle up. <br> <br>
<div class="dramatic">

I was born to two ski bums who decided, <span class="highlight">“Let’s have a baby and start a business in the same year!”</span> 
It worked out great, except I ended up moving schools 13 times and was born into an unpaid internship.
<span class="pause"></span>
<div class="together">

</div>

 <span class="pause"></span>
 <div class="whisper">(Kidding. Sort of. I did end up making product designs and emerging from under conference tables to pitch, from Colorado to Sydney.)</div>
 <span class="pause"></span>
 Naturally, I <span class="highlight">didn't like school much</span> 
 <span class="pause"></span>
Curriculums never matched. I once had to learn Japanese... in French. <span class="whisper">(I don't know French.)</span> 
 <span class="pause"></span>
   I was accelerated, decelerated, put into speech therapy for my accent, then reprimanded for missing the classes they were taking
   me out of. I was too cheeky, too loud,  too argumentative. I held my ground when I knew I was right. Teachers didn't 
   like me, despite being the top of the class.
   <span class="pause"></span>
   The structures were absurd.
   <span class="pause"></span>
    This led to me retreating into my computer. These people will be replaced by a new cast in 6 months, my computer won't.
    Thus began the best time of my life.<br>
  <span class="pause"></span> <span class="pause"></span>
     <span class="echo">Pokemon, Minecraft, Halo.</span> (The greats)
  <span class="pause"></span>
    I watched Pokemon over 20 times by 10, sold fully trained Pokemon to people on my school bus for money to then 'invest' into Minecraft roles, had over 
    4000 hours on Minecraft building colosseum after colosseum, and would sneak out after dark to jump through the window of a similarly lonely person and we would boot up Halo.
  <span class="pause"></span>
    I was this elusive transfer kid in every homeroom that would never show up to school. 
   <span class="pause"></span>
   I would also sneak out to the garage and Macguyver ziplines or declare that I was going to make a tree house (for the 11th time.) I skipped school a lot after learning if I aced my classes and had a 50% attendance mark I would pass. Finding 
   a few good bathroom windows to jump from. I mastered the art of being 'sick' on days too snowy to walk home. The walk being 4 kilometers up a mountain, normally in snow.
  
    <span class="pause"></span>
   <img src="../images/walkHome.png" style="width: 33em; height: auto;" alt="Google Earth screenshot with red line drawing out the route home up the hill."/>
   <span class="pause"></span>
  <div class="together">
    <div>
      <p>I started to toy around with the idea of being a programmer. I knew deep down that I would always love travelling
        and meeting interesting people. The flexibility and the fact that it was like art were huge to me.
      A friend dragged me to her dad’s game-dev class so she wouldn’t be alone. I left with my first 3D model, <i>Penelope the Bunny</i>, and an obsession with Unity fog settings.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="../images/penny.png" style="width: 16em; height: auto;" alt="Image of her first CAD design."/>
  </div>

  <span class="pause"></span>

  I got really into developing 3D games for VR, I can still recall meticulously timing and animating each cloud to be just right. I remember setting
  out the map as much as the Grand Canyon in Unreal Engine as I could, and I still have
  some of the concept art of "Laplaces Lair" that took a physics twist on games similar to Super Smash Bros (I did these when I was a little bit older, around 13.)
    <span class="pause"></span>
    <img src="../images/sketchesLaplace.png" style="width: 33em; height: auto;" alt="Character designs for her game."/>

  <span class="pause"></span>
From 11-14, I was certain that school was baby sitting.
 <span class="pause"></span>
All of my friends existed in another online world that felt more real to me. I would  go into virtual spaces with them, or stay in call for hours as we would play Overwatch or Dungeons and Dragons in VRChat.
After playing for three straight days of Overwatch until the TV blacked out and the PS4 started smoking, I looked up at the ceiling and asked,
 <span class="whisper">
  "What am I doing with my life?
  </span>
    <span class="pause"></span>
    I had learned the game, had everything I wanted. I did sports well, I played games for days,
    I was the debate champion of the region, I was getting community medals, I was learning how to paint from professional
    painters. I consistently got podium after podium. My dad and sister both were on the national 
    ski team - and I was put into an athlete school. I picked up things fast. <br> <br>
  But it still felt hollow.
    <span class="pause"></span>
      <div class="together">

  </div>
 <span class="pause"></span>
    I needed something harder.
  <div class="together">
    <div>
      <p>That, compounded with a silly accident where I almost died of hypothermia in a blizzard earlier in the year while trapped on a mountain range, all made me even more set on not going outside for anything
        that wasn't functional.  I was
known for my cubby in the closet by this stage. This tipped me to a breaking point. I needed a circuit breaker, I needed a challenge,
I needed to feel uncomfortable.
    </div>
    <img src="../images/freesiaLost.jpg" style="width:6em; height: auto;" alt="Missing person poster of Freesia."/>
  </div>
  <span class="pause"></span>
  <div class="dramatic">
I declared that I would live with my grandparents in Australia so that I could apply to University without my transcript
being a nightmare to any admissions officer. <div class="whisper">(Which was true.)</div> 
  <span class="pause"></span>
As my parents planned to wave their good byes and fly back to Canada, the pandemic hit. Then my dad got diagnosed with
stage 4 cancer, so they stayed in the country and sold their business.
  <span class="pause"></span>
I remember spending 18 days in a Discord call with 7 of my online friends, essentially living in VR, Minecraft, OSU (one of my friends was top 100 in the world so I made cover art for his videos), or working on hobbies. We challenged ourselves
to see how long we could stay in it for. At this stage coding as a job was the plan. I liked that you didn't need a degree to prove that you weren't 
dumb. <span class="highlight">I liked the culture of freedom. </span> CS50 is just online, loads of MIT courses are just online, you can learn anything!
  <span class="pause"></span>
At this stage, I had made one friend at my actual school, and he sent me a quantum computing course ran my MIT and Google over messages and jabbed, <span class="highlight">"You would do something like this." </span>  Spitefully, I applied for a full scholarship. I ended up getting in and only then realised at that point the gravity of it. This was a university style 
courses for two semesters, taught by some interesting people. It was on every night on the weekend for two semesters (12am-3am, as I live in Australia and 
it was US-based.) I got a 98% by the end, (2% lost on attendance because I would pass out sometimes.)
  <span class="pause"></span>
I really liked it. Then I went on to just start learning more on my free time. I picked up vector calculus, fell in love with Feynman, particle 
physics, MIT OpenCourseware, editing pure math Wikipedia pages - everything. Everything was magic again. I realised how beautiful the world is, 
mathematically and philosophically. 
  <span class="pause"></span>
At this stage I had something called the <span class="highlight">"Question Book."</span> 
<span class="pause"></span> 
</div>
    <img src="../images/questionBook.jpg" style="width: 33em; height: auto;" alt="A book full of questions."/>
<span class="pause"></span>
  <div class="dramatic">

I would think about something simple. e.g. <div class="echo">"What is colour?"</div> <span class="pause"></span> 
<div class="together">Then I would run off and research it relentlessly. I had a blog at the time, and I would write to nobody. I called it "On Zero," it was a nod to how 
everything I learned started from a complete beginning, and something about starting completely on zero is just thrilling. This is a screenshot of a part of one of the old blog posts on the right.
<img src="../images/onZeroBlog.png" style="width: 15em; height: auto;"  alt="A screenshot of her blog"></div>
  <span class="pause"></span>
(My favourite topic ended up being light scattering. Light is amazing.)
  <span class="pause"></span>
I would just play pretend PhD. I was really into Scott Aaronson's blog at the time, which inspired it. I'd make experiments or just find every book I could on things like solid state physics or make 
flash cards on shearing effects, how to classify rigid bodies based on their symmetries, or how to represent quantum information.
     <span class="pause"></span>
<div class="together">
    <div>
      <p>
            <img src="../images/higgsMech.png" style="width: 16em; height: auto;" alt="Screenshot of a Higgs Mechanism she modelled."/>
            </div>
    <img src="../images/solidState.jpeg" style="width: 16em; height: auto;" alt="A textbook she enjoyed on solid state physics."/>
  </div>
    <span class="pause"></span>
Eventually, there wasn't enough details on websites, so I changed from the "Question Book" to printing out research papers in photonic and 
semiconductor based quantum research and would read them. Whenever I encountered a word I didn't know, I would start learning about it online
using textbooks and courses. So If I didn't understand Hamiltonian, I would then run off and challenge myself to take an online course that explained it all, do the tests, 
then go back to the paper. When I started to get the hang of it, I would read the beginning and try to guess the end based on what I knew.
   <span class="pause"></span>
It was <span class="highlight">so fun.</span>
  <span class="pause"></span>
  At this point I was stacking up online courses like an achievement hunter, from astronomy to theoretical topology, I was addicted.
  I also applied to more and more quantum courses. I gravitated toward quantum because it was highly technical and had 
  a bit of everything. I applied to another course and one of the admissions ladies (who normally works for Harvard admissions) 
  said I couldn't join because I was too advanced and would be taking someone's spot. 
  I think she must have felt bad or something, because she offered to let me be a teaching assistant alongside their 
  PhD students.
  
    <span class="pause"></span>
  This was quite thrilling to a kid who was an okay report card. (It was all A's essentially, but the Pareto Principle 
  greatly inspired my cares toward achieving 100's when I could learn something real instead.) It was good for someone 
  who didn't go to class and didn't know if they wanted to go to university, but it wasn't going to get me into an incredible
   university either. It started to confirm my theory about learning. At this point I was around 16, and just continued doing 
   more and more courses and textbooks online. 
<span class="pause"></span>
I found a way to sneak to the edge of the school yard, get behind the sports shed, and run into the forest. I found a route 
through the forest from my highschool to where I was living. I told no one at my school that I was into quantum mechanics
or anything like it. Tall poppy syndrome is very real in regional areas. Eventually, one teacher found out and I told them why 
I was running home, and they stayed quiet for me. <span class="whisper">"Our little secret." </span> They were one of the only people that I will forever regard as a teacher.
 <span class="pause"></span>
   I learned that sharing my interests where I live would only lead to bullying. Broken phones, hair cut,
   getting chased in public places, computers cracked. So I had this second life. It built up my confidence, suddenly I had a tribe 
   within the comfort of anonymity. Sure, they didn't actually exist where I lived, but I didn't feel
 so alone anymore.

<div class="together">
    <div>
      <p>
        For my whole life, people in real life would either love me or they would hate me. No in-between treatment. One person, who later became my 
friend said that,
      <span class="whisper"> "You just stand out. Like you look like you should be bullied, but you just... do things anyways? 
 I think a lot of people tried to target you for that. "</span>
            </div>
    <img src="../images/spaceBuns.jpg" style="width: 9em; height: auto;" alt="Highschool photo of her with space buns."/>
  </div>
   <span class="pause"></span>
   One day, I dealt with my bullies when the 2 heads of their cult said they could beat me up. I was so done with them, that 
   even if I didn't win, I was jumping at the opportunity to get a good square punch in their faces. (I was representing the
   school for state athletics at the time and started a new record for shot put distance at the school.)
      <br>
   I said, <div class="whisper" style="text-align: center"> 2 versus 1, 5:00 pm beach, tonight.</div> 
   <br>
   I made sure a crowd of people showed up to see that they were too scared.
   After that, I gained some relative freedom from judgement until graduation. A bit later on (age 17), some younger girls were actually
   cutting their hair like me (which feels <span class="whisper">very strange,</span>) and I ran for school president with a majority vote,
   but the school leadership voted against me, essentially saying I was, "Too deviant."
     <span class="pause"></span>
  Beyond this, I became obsessed with ancient Greece and Persia, poetry, and philosophy (my favourites ended up being
   Popper, Camus, Beauvoir and Bertrand Russel). Real philosophy (not some influencers tips on 'Stoicism') <br> <br>
    I ended up making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn%E2%80%93Popper_debate">Kuhn-Popper Debate</a> Wikipedia page after having a long 
    sit down with a teacher over why I thought school was broken, which is how I stumbled upon philosophy.
     <br> <br>
    He said,
    <div class="whisper">"You seem to care a lot more about truth than passing."</div> 
    <br>
  This is what the Kuhn-Popper debate is all about. Going against 
   the masses and holding your footing based on deductive facts. A strong conviction that the most moral version
   of the world is one with open debate. This specific debate was at
    the turning point of when belief and fear started to matter more than truth in our world. 
    <span class="pause"></span>

<div class="together">
    <div>
      <p>
        Back to quantum. I'm 16, and the Sydney Quantum Academy was hosting their first
    Quantum Conference and I weaseled my way in. I ended up meeting the guy who designed the "Quantum Engineering"
     course that I chose later on when we were sat across the table and he asked me what degree I was doing and went 
     "<span class="highlight">I'm in Year 10.</span>" (I immediately got a lab tour.)
            </div>
    <img src="../images/labTour.png" style="width: 16em; height: auto;" alt="Her on a lab tour next to a quantum computer."/>
  </div>
  <span class="pause"></span>
  At this stage I still wanted to be a theoretical physicist, or a real estate agent (whichever one would give me more time and freedom to just do what I like.)
  <span class="pause"></span>
At the same time, I was starting to experiment with building physical things. 
  <span class="pause"></span>
  Go karts, swords, hydroelectric funnel prototypes for the Alps, I even wrote up a material and financial report detailing an idea to redesign an area of my high school and pitched it well enough that they actually changed it. A STEM teacher started giving me e-waste to take apart whenever I was at school, and gave me a drill, winked, and said, "<span class="highlight">Fetch me the motors.</span>"
 <div class="together">
    <img src="../images/sword.jpg" style="width: 15em; height: auto;" alt="A half-done 3D printed sword."/>
    <img src="../images/hoverBattery.jpg" style="width: 16em; height: auto;" alt="Some E-Waste she was taking apart. Big Li-on battery."/>
</div>
 
    <span class="pause"></span>
  I picked up a hobby of ripping open thrown away devices and either modding them or taking out parts I would find useful in future projects. 
     <span class="pause"></span>
  <img src="../images/pitchSchool.jpg" style="width: 33em; height: auto;" alt="Blurry picture of her in front of a whiteboard of maths she's written up."/>

  <span class="pause"></span>
  I also started road tripping during classes - I worked loads of part time jobs to buy things from department stores and pay
  for gas. I would bring a thermos and a load of ramen, some books on stars, and a telescope. I would sleep out of my car.
      <span class="pause"></span>
      It was awesome.
            <span class="pause"></span>
      Probably the funniest things that happened was, I parked my car on a field near a highway once to watch stars for the night,
      but as mist rolled into the valley, I packed up. Police drove over to the car, curious about what was going on.
            <span class="pause"></span>
        The guy walked up to me and asked,
        <div class="whisper">What are you doing here?</div> <br>
        Me, excited that someone asked me about my hobbies went,
            <div class="whisper">I'm looking at the stars!</div> <br>
        I then pointed quickly up at the pitch black sky caused by the mist.
      <div class="whisper">Hey miss, have you had any drugs or alcohol in the last 24 hours? </div> 
       <span class="pause"></span>
      This was then followed by me frantically trying to backtrack and explain why I needed to be on this exact field to
      watch what I wanted to watch, ripping telescopes and nebulae books out of my car. The guy totally thought I was bonkers. 
       <br> <br>
       This was two days after finishing my final exams, which may give you an insight into what I was thinking at the time. <br>
      (I make video time capsules to my future self.)

  After a nightmarish year (having to move again and much more. This year, I lived.) I finished high school, then a week after graduating, my dad passed. 
  Dad was the 'crazy evangelical founder' of my parents. 

  We were both absolute nightmares to live with, but it made me reflect on how he changed me in a good way. This was my 
  funeral speech.

  <div class="whisper">“Hello its... My turn. Um, so I never really understood dad, and in writing this speech I 
    was still trying to find an answer to this. So i was going through many, many photos and I kept on finding more 
    memories. And memories I wasn't apart of - wearing crazy wigs and being in crazy countries and jumping 
    off of crazy cliffs - and yeah, he would do that. <br>
    <br>
     Dad was a character who was larger than life. And for of that in the past few years it has been tainted with cancer 
     struggles, exam stress, and a few too many times fighting over the living room. I wanted to do linear algebra - He 
     wanted to write a book. 
     <br> <br>
     I can still recount many of our adventures. And I know he had many before me. As a child I 
     was a nightmare somewhat like him. I would run up the streets - naked- painted entirely 
     in purple, sleep in trucks surrounded by bears, getting lost in forests and falling off trees. 
     Honestly, im still a bit of a nightmare - perhaps with a bit less purple paint.

I can never remember when he did shout at me out of anger, normally in these situations he would kind of laugh and think it was a good idea as well. Sometimes I would want him to be mad - he was more like a brother. Funnily enough, i have lost friends because “I'm too much of a risktaker.” Not because of drugs, but because of last minute trips to the snow or hiking or kayaking. <br>
  <br>

<br><br>
I'm not the first thing you think of when you image a teenage risk taker. But those friends were definitely 
not for me in the end if they could not go on a last minute trip. 
<br> <br>
Dad was a spontaneous man for much of my life. I would add a spontaneous nightmare but I would be a 
hypocrite in saying that.
I think amongst the chaos i would not had learned things otherwise if he was not my dad. He was not 
a normal dad. He was not the sort of guy to ask why he was the kind of guy to ask "Why not?"
As in why cant my child drive a manual on a carpark full of ice? Why cant my ten year old make a 
zipline? Or why cant my child join me to business conferences? Later, this caused me to go on my own to a 
business conference full of physicists - and thats my current trajectory in life.

He was funny and constantly pushing me outside of my comfort zone until it became second nature. 
And I would ask myself, “Yeah why cant I travel 7 hours up to a conference in Sydney full of physicists? 
I may not know too much physics but I have the spirit!”
     <br> <br>
I learned everybody has flaws, and he had major flaws. But ahh, well in the end, he was definitely a net positive, 
and I learned al ot from him about how to see the world. As in “Why not start a skiing business? Why not jump off this cliff? 
Why not go for a swim at this next beach? "Why not?"" is an infinitely valuable question, and he was full of it.

I used to think he was nuts, now I know crazy is only defined by the majority. The majority of people aren't very happy.
Go out there and really ask yourself, 
    <span class="pause"></span>
          "Why not?”
    <span class="pause"></span>
I'm always scared. Always. But I do what I want to do anyways. I'm so glad that I do.
<br><br>
 From there, I continued teaching quantum mechanics alongside PhD's, went to UNSW for Quantum Engineering, and was a podium finisher for an MIT hackathon on my first day of university...<div class="whisper">Blah, Blah, Blah. My resume is on LinkedIn. </div> 
           <br> <br>
<div class="together">  
  For the first time in my life, I met some beautiful friends. Made memories I'll never forget. (We also totally pretended to run 
a rollerblading society.) Though I also realised the stuff that I learned before university was at least 4 years out academically, so I got really bored.
I never liked school, I did well to unlock opportunities, but opportunities in 4 years!?

  At this point I started getting into embedded systems, a new challenge. I could do this in my room, and no one could
stop me. I didn't need a dilution fridge to do it. I was making projects out of my closet
to prove to myself that I knew something real. Here was my totally nuts dorm room (the mattress is under the bed frame held up by books.)
<br><br>

      <span class="pause"></span>
<div class="highlight">As you can see, my faith in static friction is pretty strong. </div>
<br><br>
I absolutely love this, it's essentially applied snakes and ladders + wizardry. I started working on my own side projects throughout
my first year, while tearing apart e-waste to remind myself why I love this stuff so much.
<br><br>
Soon, I dreamed of typing in air while frustrated on a train over the summer. My favourite video game character could do it, why can't I?
The game is based in 2070, and that's coming soon enough!
<br><br>
 So that's what I'm doing right now.
<br><br>
I could write and write, but that's most of me up until now. I tried to omit some accolades and insane stories so I didn't write a proper
book. There's many more deaths, sharks, poisonings, caves, and adventures - but you have to know me too get access to the next chapters.

                  That's right! I'm a dual-citizen (Australian-Canadian), I have spent the majority of my life in Australia, but was born to two entrepreneurs who moved to Canada to found a successful skiing business! <br> <br>
                  I spent much of my life moving back and forth (going to 13 schools!)
                  <br> <br> Because I moved so much I started to really enjoy playing games on my computer, and eventually a friend invited me to a video-game making class her dad was hosting when I was young, then later on I looked up "CS50." 
                  <br> <br> The rest is history! :)
