  <!-- Story of my life (LOL) -->
  <div class="hero-abt">
<div class="text-lg">"How did I get here?""</div> <br> <br> <br>
<div class="text-md hero-abt"> I am often asked this, especially about my childhood, so for the very curious, here's a tale.
</div>
  <div class="text-md hero-abt">Buckle up. <br> <br>
<div class="dramatic">

I was born to two ski bums who decided, <span class="highlight">“Let’s have a baby and start a business in the same year!”</span> 
It worked out great, except I ended up moving schools 13 times and was born into an unpaid internship.
 <span class="pause"></span>
 <div class="whisper">(Kidding, sort of.)</div>
 <span class="pause"></span>
 Naturally, I <span class="highlight">didn't like school much</span> 
 <span class="pause"></span>
Curriculums never matched. Teachers forgot I existed. I once had to learn Chinese... in French. <span class="whisper">(I don't know French.)</span> 
 <span class="pause"></span>
   I was accelerated, decelerated, put into speech therapy for my accent, then the school would get upset at me missing the classes they were taking
   me out of. I was too cheeky, too loud, or too argumentative. Always too much. 
   <span class="pause"></span>
    This led to me retreating into my computer. It was the only thing that I had that I knew wouldn't leave when I moved to the next school.<br>
    Thus began the best time of my life.<br>
  <span class="pause"></span> <span class="pause"></span>
     <span class="echo">Pokemon, Minecraft, Halo.</span> (The greats)
  <span class="pause"></span>
    I watched Pokemon over 20 times by 10, sold fully trained Pokemon to people on my school bus for money to then 'invest' into Minecraft roles, had over 
    4000 hours on Minecraft building colosseum after colosseum, and would sneak out after dark to jump through the window of a similarly lonely person and we would boot up Halo.
  <span class="pause"></span>
    I was this elusive transfer kid in every homeroom that would never show up to school. 
   <span class="pause"></span>
   I would also sneak out to the garage and Macguyver ziplines or declare that I was going to make a tree house (for the 11th time.) I skipped school a lot after learning if I aced my classes and had a 50% attendance mark I would pass. Finding 
   a few good bathroom windows to jump from. I master the art of being 'sick' on days too snowy to walk home. This meant I had a lot more time to 
   learn things.
  <span class="pause"></span>
  I started to toy around with the idea of being a programmer. 
  A friend dragged me to her dad’s game-dev class so she wouldn’t be alone. I left with my first 3D model, <i>Penelope the Bunny</i>, and an obsession with Unity fog settings. 
  <span class="pause"></span>
  I got really into developing 3D games for VR, I can still recall meticulously timing and animating each cloud to be just right.
  <span class="pause"></span>
By 11-14, I was certain that school was just baby sitting.
 <span class="pause"></span>
All of my friends existed in another online world that felt more real to me. I would  go into virtual spaces with them, or stay in call for hours as we would play Overwatch or Dungeons and Dragons in VRChat.
After playing for three straight days of Overwatch until the TV blacked out and the PS4 started smoking, I looked up at the ceiling and asked,
 <span class="pause"></span>  
 <div class="whisper"> "What am I doing with my life?</div>

  <span class="pause"></span>
That, compounded with a silly accident where I almost died in the mountains in a blizzard earlier in the year, which made me even more set on not going outside tipped to a breaking point. I was
known for my cubby in the closet by this stage. I coded, did art, all of my time was spent on hobbies or games.
  <span class="pause"></span>
Eventually, I got tired of moving and declared that I would live with my grandparents in Australia so that I could apply to University without my transcript
being a nightmare to any admissions officer. <div class="whisper">(That's what I say, but in reality, I wanted to see what it was like to live in one place.)</div> 
  <span class="pause"></span>
As my parents planned to wave their good byes and fly back to Canada, the pandemic hit. The pandemic was the best time of my life. Now I was <span class="highlight">forced</span>
not to go to school. How good!
  <span class="pause"></span>
I remember spending 18 days in a Discord call with 7 of my online friends, essentially living in VR, OSU, or working on our hobbies. We challenged ourselves
to see how long we could stay in it for. At this stage coding as a job was the plan. I liked that you didn't need a degree to prove that you weren't 
dumb. <span class="highlight">I liked the culture of freedom. </span> CS50 is just online, loads of MIT courses are just online, you can learn anything!
  <span class="pause"></span>
At this stage, I had made one friend at my actual school, and he sent me a quantum computing course ran my MIT and Google over messages and jabbed, <span class="highlight">"You would do something like this." </span>  Spitefully, I applied for a full scholarship. I ended up getting in and only then realised at that point the gravity of it. This was a university style 
courses for two semesters, taught by some interesting people. It was on every night on the weekend for two semesters (12am-3am, as I live in Australia and 
it was US-based.) I got a 98% by the end, (2% lost on attendance because I would pass out sometimes.)
  <span class="pause"></span>
I really liked it. Then I went on to just start learning more on my free time. I picked up vector calculus, fell in love with Feynman, particle 
physics, MIT OpenCourseware, editing pure math Wikipedia pages - everything. Everything was magic again. I realised how beautiful the world is, 
mathematically and philosophically. 
  <span class="pause"></span>
At this stage I had something called the <span class="highlight">"Question Book."</span> 
<span class="pause"></span> 
I would think about something simple. e.g. <div class="echo">"What is colour?"</div> <span class="pause"></span> Then I would run off and research it relentlessly. I had a blog at the time, and I would write to nobody. I called it "On Zero," it was a nod to how 
everything I learned started from a complete beginning, and something about starting completely on zero is just thrilling.
  <span class="pause"></span>
(My favourite topic ended up being light scattering.)
  <span class="pause"></span>
The blogs had figures, were written in LaTex and all, and I would just play pretend PhD. I was really into Scott Aaronson's blog at the time, which inspired it.I'd make experiments or just find every book I could on things like solid state physics or make 
flash cards on shearing effects, how to classify rigid bodies based on their symmetries, or how to represent quantum information.

Eventually there wasn't enough details on websites, so I eventually changed from the "Question Book" to printing out research papers in photonic and 
semiconductor based quantum research and would read them. Whenever I encountered a word I didn't know, I would start learning about it online
using textbooks and courses. So If I didn't understand Hamiltonian, I would then run off and challenge myself to take an online course that explained it all, do the tests, 
then go back to the paper. When I started to get the hang of it, I would read the beginning and try to guess the end based on what I knew.
<br>
 It was <span class="highlight">so fun.</span>
  <span class="pause"></span>
  At this point I was racking up online courses like an achievement hunter, so as I applied to more and more quantum courses, eventually one of the admissions ladies (who normally works for Harvard admissions) said I couldn't join because I was too advanced and would be taking someone's spot. I think she must have felt bad or something, because she offered to let me be a teaching assistant alongside their PhD students.
  <span class="pause"></span>
  This was quite thrilling to a kid who was an okay report card. (It was all A's essentially, but the Pareto Principle greatly inspired my cares toward achieving 100's when I could learn something real instead.) It was good for someone who didn't go to class and didn't know if they wanted to go to university, but it wasn't going to get me into an incredible university either. It started to confirm my theory about learning. At this point I was around 16, and just continued doing more and more courses and textbooks online. Eventually, the Sydney Quantum Academy was hosting their first Quantum Conference and I weaseled my way in. I ended up meeting the guy who designed the "Quantum Engineering" course that I chose later on when we were sat across the table and he asked me what degree I was doing and went "<span class="highlight">I'm in Year 10.</span>" (I immediately got a lab tour.)
  <span class="pause"></span>
  At this stage I still wanted to be a theoretical physicist, or a real estate agent (whichever one would give me more time and freedom to just do what I like.)
  <span class="pause"></span>
At the same time, I was starting to experiment with building physical things.
  <span class="pause"></span>
  Go karts, hydroelectric funnel prototypes for the Alps, I even wrote up a material and financial report detailing an idea to redesign an area of my high school and pitched it well enough that they actually changed it. A STEM teacher started giving me E-Waste to take apart whenever I was at school, and gave me a drill, winked, and said, "<span class="highlight">Fetch me the motors.</span>"
  <span class="pause"></span>
From there, I continued teaching quantum mechanics alongside PhD's, went to UNSW for Quantum Engineering, and was a podium finisher for an MIT hackathon on my first day of university! <br> <br>
<br>
I could write and write, but that's most of me before I was 18!

                  Quantum engineering is this cool intersection between three of my favourite things: electrical engineering, physics, and computers! <br> <br> It's a degree that promised to never run out of problems.
                  My degree essentially trains me as an electrical engineer with higher expectations, while still emphasising low-level coding abilities and competence with physics. Beyond the core content of my degree, my electives are going to focus on telecommunications and microelectronics.

                  I spent much of my life moving back and forth (going to 13 schools!)
                  <br> <br> Because I moved so much I started to really enjoy playing games on my computer, and eventually a friend invited me to a video-game making class her dad was hosting when I was young, then later on I looked up "CS50."
